Learning GPU from scratch

1. gpufunc - qt-application to understand basic GPU transformations
2. rtl - System Verilog source code
3. prj - Makefiles to build rtl for different targets: KC705 board, simulation
4. examples - different application to emulate or interact with the FPGA board

## Hardware

Use 'riscv_vhdl' project and additional IP blocks for KC705 board:

- PCIe endpoint IP.
- HDMI transceivers.
